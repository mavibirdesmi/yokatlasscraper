# yokatlasscraper

Welcome to yokatlassraper!
  * This scraper was done in order to help my friends to get data about their wanted department with in a certain score range.
  * yokatlas doesn't have terms about scraping their data so I didn't include any delay's, so the time you spend is actually only depended on your internet connection and computer speed
  * You will need to install python, requirements.txt and download chromedriver (don't forget to specify the path in yokatlasparameters.py) 
  <br>
To install requirements type $ pip install requirements.txt
